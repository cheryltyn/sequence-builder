### YogiBuild

Introducing YogiBuild, a website that helps yoga instructor build better sequence. As a yoga instructor who sometimes teaches yoga, I’m constantly struggling with coming up with new sequences every week. As such, I wanted to use a LLM to help me create yoga sequences. 

### Screenshots:

### Technologies Used:

1. HTML/CSS: Used Chakra UI for the CSS framework 
2. OpenAI API to provide the sequences based on certain input parameters 
3. Airtable API to read and store data 
4. Figma to design my website 
5. React framework and Javascript to run the website 

### Next Steps:

1. **Increase the input parameters:** I’m currently only including focus area and duration as an option. Moving forward, I like to introduce more inputs to the API, which includes type of yoga, more focus areas for the body, Sanskirt or English and additional cues etc. 
2. ********************************************************Allowing reiterations:******************************************************** In ChatGPT, you’re able to provide feedback and ask for changes in the sequence. I would like to include that so users can reiterate on their sequence. 
3. ******************************************************Securing storing API keys:****************************************************** I’m excited to learn backend so I can secure my API keys.
